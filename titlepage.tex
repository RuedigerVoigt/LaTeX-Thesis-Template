\begin{titlepage}
% Normally \meaketitle inserts a pagebreak after the title.
% This makes sense, but in the draft phase I want avoid that.
% So instead of just witing \maketitle, I suppress that behavior
% by using the following line:
{\let\newpage\relax\maketitle}
\ \\
\vfill % fill vertical space and push the paragraph below 
% down the page
